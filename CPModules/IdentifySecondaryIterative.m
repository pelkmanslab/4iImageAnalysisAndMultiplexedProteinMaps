% Help for the IdentifySecondaryIterative module:
% Category: Object Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Identifies objects (e.g. cell edges) using "seed" objects identified by
% an Identify Primary module (e.g. nuclei). See the help of Cell Profiler's
% original IdentifySecondary module for more details.
%
% In contrast to the orignal module, sequential rounds of watershedding are
% done. The outcome will be a very precise cell outline segmentation, which
% does not need a lot of human supervision (and thus greatly reduces
% working time). However, since this modulce can take up to 30 min on a
% single image, you might not want to use it, if you do not have access to
% massive parallel computing facilities.
%
% This module identifies secondary objects by sequential watershedding.
% This allows to combine the advantage of a high threshold correction
% factor (correct allocation of pixels to cells within crowded regions)
% with the advantage of a low threshold correction factor (detection of
% cellular periphery in sparse regions).
%
% To prevent false positives, if very few primary objects are present,
% limits for threshold can be used.
%
%
% SUGGESTION TO FIND MINIMAL BACKGROUND - ROBUST CAMERA / IMAGING
% CONDITIONS
% If using sCMOS cameras, the intensity value, which corresponds to
% background signal from the chip is ~100 greyscale values. Distinctive
% cell-specific signal from the cell outline stain can usually be detected
% at ~125 greyscale values. The minimal background value thus corresponds
% to 0.0019 (125/2^16)
%
% SUGGESTION TO FIND MINIMAL BACKGROUND - VIA IDENTIFYSECONDARY
% Get lowest threshold, which does not yet recognize background as
% cells.
% Make a CP pipeline with several IdentifySecondary modules. In each one
% select a different threshold correction value. Use OTSU GLOBAL and
% WATERSHEDDING
% Now start the pipeline. Of all modules, which do not recognize the
% background, use the one with the smallest threshold correction value
% (for us this is frequently around 0.5). Then manually write down the
% exact threshold value of this module. It will be displayed in the
% window opened by this module.
%
% Do not bother, whether the cells are
% correclty segmented. The only important point is that the outline of the
% cell has to be detected fully. Make sure that the test image is
% representative of your assay. Usually spreading cells do require a much
% lower threshold value than cells in crowded environemnts.
%
% SETTING UP THE IDENTIFYSECONDARYITERATIVE MODULE
%
% THRESHOLD CORRECTION FACTORS. IN DESCENDING RANKING.
% Should indicate many
% different thresholds. It starts with the most stringent and starts with
% the lowest. The lowest one should be so low that it would recognize the
% background as an object.
%
% Note that you do not care about:
% x the number of thresholds. The more, the better. Use supercomputing.
% Applying around 20 different ones usually gives very robust results. You
% can not select too many thresholds. You can save days of manual work by
% not selecting (a single) individual threshold(s).
% x the specific value of the lowest threshold: The lowest value has to be
% lower than the lowest threshold correction, which you tested previously.
% It should be a threshold value that recognizes the background. The
% separation from the background will be done by a later option. If the
% last threshold corrction value is too high, the periphery of spreading
% cells might be missed.
%
% An example for the range would be 1.1 1.05 1 0.95 0.9 0.85 0.8 0.75 0.7
% 0.6 0.58 0.55 0.50 0.45 0.4 0.35 0.3 0.25
%
% Usually the best gain in segmentation quality per threshold is achived
% with threshold correction factors close to the threshold correction
% factor, which you would choose in the normal IdentifySecondary module
%
% LOWER AND UPPER BONDS ON THRESHOLD.
% These values correspond to the minimal and maximal values that a
% threshold is allowed to have. They have the format
% SmallestThreshold,HighestThreshold
% For SmallestThreshold you should use the value obtained in c). Leaving
% the maximal value at 1 has worked fine for us all the time. Setting a
% minimal value will prevent recognition of the background as an object
%
%
% *************************************************************************
%
%
% How it works>
% This is a heavily adjusted version of the orignal IdentifySecondary module
% It also has lower memory requiremnts and fixes some bugs of the original
% module (shrinkage of nuclei, expansion of surrounding objects discarded by
% DiscardSinglePixel)
%
% 0) Obtain masks with proper foreground objects.
%
% 1)sequential watershedding
%
% 2)Then one label image is constructed. If a pixel is part of different
% objects at given threshold (which is likely in cell rich regions), it will be
% allocated to the threshold which was defined prior. eg. if thresholds
% specifications were 1 and 0.5 it would be attributed to the object
% identified with a threshold of 1. If threshold specification was 0.5 1
% it would be attributed to the object identified at 0.5
%
% 3) Cleaning up step. It could happen that an object would end up
% separated into multiple fragments (which in most cases would be
% biologically meaningless). Thus all fragments except the one, which
% includes the primary object, are set to background
